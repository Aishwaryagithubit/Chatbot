## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Start a session**: The user enters their name, and a virtual agent is randomly assigned.
2. **Ask questions**: The chatbot matches keywords from the `info.json` database and responds accordingly.
3. **Fallback support**: If no keyword matches, a random message from `responses.txt` is shown.
4. **Learning mode**: Users can teach the bot new responses, which are saved back to `info.json`.
5. **Logging**: All user-agent conversations are recorded in `recordlog.txt` for future analysis.
