# 🎓 University Chatbot System

An intelligent terminal based chatbot built with Python for simulating a responsive university inquiry system.

## 🚀 Overview

This chatbot serves as an interactive command line assistant that responds to user queries using keyword matching. It is designed to:

- Simulate realistic university-related conversations.
- Provide a flexible agent interaction experience.
- Evolve over time through real-time learning from users.

## 📦 Features

✅ **Smart Keyword Recognition**  
✅ **Customizable Agent Interaction**  
✅ **Response Training via User Input**  
✅ **Persistent JSON-Based Knowledge Base**  
✅ **Fallback Randomized Responses**  
✅ **Complete Conversation Logging**  

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Start a session**: The user enters their name, and a virtual agent is randomly assigned.
2. **Ask questions**: The chatbot matches keywords from the `info.json` database and responds accordingly.
3. **Fallback support**: If no keyword matches, a random message from `responses.txt` is shown.
4. **Learning mode**: Users can teach the bot new responses, which are saved back to `info.json`.
5. **Logging**: All user-agent conversations are recorded in `recordlog.txt` for future analysis.
